# Assetic-API
A Python Class to Authenticate with Assetic

This is a Class to Authenticate and Make Endpoint calls to the Assetic API. I used the Assets endpoint as an example.

Steps:

1) Register yourself in the Assetic Portal
2) Store your username and password in the Admin.py
3) Run the Assetic_Token_Class.py
4) Add another function to call from within the get_assets function to do something with the returned data.
